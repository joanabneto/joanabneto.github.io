text: "This was a book I did during my experience as an Au Pair in Iceland.<br> It's meant to retell a bit of what went on, on the 1st year of life of the child I was taking care of. Since we can't recall ourselves of how our 1st year of life was, this kind of book serves as a memoir made by those close to us that can tell us how we and the world around us was when we were one."
