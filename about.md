### Hi!

I'm Joana, an amateur illustrator and noob at Web Development that enjoys trying out new things.

I'm a recent graduate in International Relation, but I like to combine different areas of interest, so politics, illustration, photography... 

Right now, I just engaged in a new adventure: learning Web Development; and so this website is the result of my first experience codding.

Here you can find some of my illustration work and hopefully in the future, more projects that I got myself into!

Hope you like it!
