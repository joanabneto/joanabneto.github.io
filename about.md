### Hi!

I'm Joana, an amateur illustrator and a noob at Web Development that enjoys trying out new things.

I've graduated in International Relations and in my free time I like to combine different areas of interest, from politics to illustration and beyond! 

Here you can find some of my illustration work and hopefully in the future, more projects that I got myself into.

Hope you like it!
